        <p>HTML, acronym for HyperText Markup Language, refers to the markup language for 
the elaboration of web pages. It is a standard that serves as a reference for 
software that connects with the elaboration of web pages in their different 
versions, defines a basic structure and a code (called HTML code) for the 
definition of the content of a web page, such as text, images, videos, games, 
among others. It is a standard by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) or WWW
 Consortium, an organization dedicated to the standardization of almost all 
 technologies linked to the web, especially with regard to their writing and
  interpretation. HTML is considered the most important web language, being 
  its crucial invention in the emergence, development and expansion of the World
   Wide Web (WWW). It is the standard that has been imposed in the visualization 
   of web pages and is the one that all current browsers have adopted.1</p>

      <p>A high-level definition JavaScript is a scripting or programming
        language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages —
        every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static
        information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates,
        interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes,
        etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</p>
      <p>It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies,
        two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in
        other parts of the Learning Area</p>
