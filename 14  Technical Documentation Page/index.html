        <p>HTML, acronym for HyperText Markup Language, refers to the markup language for 
the elaboration of web pages. It is a standard that serves as a reference for 
software that connects with the elaboration of web pages in their different 
versions, defines a basic structure and a code (called HTML code) for the 
definition of the content of a web page, such as text, images, videos, games, 
among others. It is a standard by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) or WWW
 Consortium, an organization dedicated to the standardization of almost all 
 technologies linked to the web, especially with regard to their writing and
  interpretation. HTML is considered the most important web language, being 
  its crucial invention in the emergence, development and expansion of the World
   Wide Web (WWW). It is the standard that has been imposed in the visualization 
   of web pages and is the one that all current browsers have adopted.1</p>

    <p>
      In the HTML Section, we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents. 
      These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs 
      break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from
       the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the 
       browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit styling 
       is specified by the author of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the web would be a boring place if all websites looked like that. Using CSS, you can control
       exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.
       Example of some CSS lines:
    </p>
<pre><code>
html{
font-size:20px;
}
body{
background-color:hsl(206, 26%, 28%,0.6);
height: 100vw;
}
main{
position: absolute;
}
.main-section>header{
font-size: 1.2rem;
}
</code></pre>

      <p>A high-level definition JavaScript is a scripting or programming
        language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages —
        every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static
        information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates,
        interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes,
        etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</p>
      <p>It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies,
        two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in
        other parts of the Learning Area</p>
<pre><code>const para = document.querySelector('p');
para.addEventListener('click', updateName); function updateName() {
const name = prompt('Enter a new name'); para.textContent = `Player 1:
${name}`; }
</code></pre>

<p>
  React (also called React.js or ReactJS) is an open source Javascript library designed 
  to create user interfaces with the aim of facilitating the development of applications 
  on a single page. It is maintained by Facebook and the free software community. 
  There are more than a thousand free developers in the project.
</p>
  
<p>
  React tries to help developers build applications that use data that changes all the time.
  Its goal is to be simple, declarative and easy to combine. React only handles the use
  r interface in an application; React is the View in a context in which the MVC 
  (Model-View-Controller) or MVVM (Model-View-Model) is used. It can also be used with 
  React-based extensions that take care of non-UI parts (which are not part of the user 
  interface) of a web application.
 
</p>
<p>
  According to the JavaScript analytics service, Libscore, React is currently being used 
  on the main pages of Imgur, Bleacher Informe, Feedly, Airbnb, SeatGeek, HelloSign,
   among others.

<p>
  What is JSX?
  JSX is a JavaScript Extension Syntax used in React to easily write HTML and JavaScript together.
  Take a look at the below code:
</p>

<pre><code>const jsx =  &lt;h1>This is JSX &lt;/h1>
</code></pre>
<p>
This is simple JSX code in React. But the browser does not understand this JSX
   because it's not valid JavaScript code. This is because we're assigning an HTML 
   tag to a variable that is not a string but just HTML code.

  <h3>
    What is Angular?
  </h3>
 
This topic can help you understand Angular: what Angular is, what advantages it provides,
 and what you might expect as you start to build your applications.

Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
  </li>
  <li>
    A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, 
    including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
  </li>
  <li>
    A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  With Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer
   projects to enterprise-level applications. Angular is designed to make updating as
    straightforward as possible, so take advantage of the latest developments with minimal
     effort. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 
     million developers, library authors, and content creators.
</p>
<section class="main-section" id="Section_TypeScript">
  <header id="Section_TypeScript">Section TypeScript</header>
<p>
  TypeScript is a primary language for Angular application development. 
  It is a superset of JavaScript with design-time support for type safety and tooling.
</p>
<p>
Browsers can't execute TypeScript directly. Typescript must be "transpiled" into 
JavaScript using the tsc compiler, which requires some configuration.
Example of TypeScript:
</p>


<pre><code>
  const user: User = {
    name: "Hayes",
    id: 0,
  };
  </code></pre>
<p>
  
  Benefits of TypeScript: Why should you use it?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>

    Precise defining through typing. ...
  </li>
  <li>
    Types make code management easier. ...

  </li>
  <li>

    Increased team performance. ...
  </li>
  <li>

    TypeScript is popular and trusted by the biggest players in the industry.
